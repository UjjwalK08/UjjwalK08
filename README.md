# 👋 Hey there, curious coder!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m **Ujjwal Khanna**, a curious data wrangler, part-time bug whisperer, and full-time fan of beautifully messy datasets.

---

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
Turning **daily NASA climate data into hourly weather insights** using deep learning models like TiDE and GRUs.  
Why? Because weather apps deserve more accuracy than “mostly cloudy with a chance of disappointment.”  
Also experimenting with time series forecasting models and scaling them using **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, and **some optimism**.

---

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Projects that sit at the intersection of:
- 🌍 **Environmental science** and **AI**
- 💼 **Business analytics** and **storytelling**
- 💡 Anything that involves **real-world impact** through **machine learning**, **data visualization**, or **cloud pipelines**

Bonus points if it involves:
- Geospatial data  
- Creative problem-solving  
- Coffee-fueled brainstorming ☕

---

## 🧠 I’m looking for help with:
- Getting TiDE models to behave (currently training one that thinks it's auditioning for a role in *Tenet*)
- Optimizing inverse scaling for accurate RMSE in Kelvin
- Building model pipelines that don’t fall apart when looked at sternly

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- How to **time travel with time series data**
- Deeper **PyTorch architecture design** (LSTM, GRU, TiDE, TS-Mixer – you name it)
- **Cloud deployment** and MLOps on **AWS/GCP**, especially using **Databricks**, **Kepler.gl**, and **Docker**
- How to stop overfitting and start generalizing (emotionally and statistically)

---

## 💬 Ask me about:
- 🧠 Modeling weird temporal patterns
- 🌡️ Working with NASA NEX-GDDP-CMIP6, ERA5, or climate data in general
- 🗺️ Building compelling geospatial dashboards using Kepler.gl or Folium
- 🔍 Data storytelling: because insights are only useful if you can *make people care*
- 🧽 Cleaning the messiest datasets with pandas, regex, and a lot of patience

---

## ⚡ Fun fact:
- Once ran an XGBoost model while cooking—almost burned the garlic, but got a 0.56 RMSE 🍝📉  
- Have more CSVs than photos on my laptop 📂❤️  
- Fluent in three languages: **Python, sarcasm, and SQL**  
- Still convinced that the best machine learning model is a well-labeled dataset

Feel free to fork, star, or just say hi! Always open to learning, sharing, and building cool things together 🚀
